### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a software engineer with a strong focus on Java web development frameworks, database management, and containerization technologies. Over +8 years, I have honed my skills in creating robust and scalable solutions for complex challenges. My educational journey includes a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Alberta, where I delved into the realms of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Database technologies, exploring areas such as Open Entity Resolution, Neural Networks, NLP, LLM, Text Classification, and Entity Matching. 

- During my career, I've made contributions as a Java Enterprise Developer at Aimsio, where I worked on field management SaaS, and gained valuable leadership experience as a Software Engineer and Technical Lead for a private cloud platform and storage team at Fanap. My time as a Teaching Assistant/Research Assistant at the University of Alberta's Database Lab further strengthened my expertise in SQL and MongoDB.
