### Hi there 👋

- ⚡ I am a dedicated and experienced software engineer with a strong focus on Java web development frameworks, database management, and containerization technologies. Over the course of 7 years, I have honed my skills in creating robust and scalable solutions for complex challenges. My educational journey includes a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Alberta, where I delved into the fascinating realms of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Database technologies, exploring areas such as Open Entity Resolution, Neural Networks, NLP, LLM, Text Classification, and Entity Matching. 

- 🔭 During my career, I've made impactful contributions as a Java Enterprise Developer at Aimsio, where I worked on field management SaaS, and gained valuable leadership experience as a Software Engineer and Technical Lead for a private cloud platform and storage team at Fanap Co. My time as a Teaching Assistant/Research Assistant at the University of Alberta's Database Lab further strengthened my expertise in SQL and MongoDB. 

- 🌱 I am passionate about continuous learning and innovation, striving to deliver cutting-edge solutions that make a meaningful impact in the tech world.
